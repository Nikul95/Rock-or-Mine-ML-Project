# Rock-or-Mine-ML-Project
Logistic Regression Model Project by Nikul

This is my first Machine Learning project using Python. The Sonar data set used for this project comes from the study undertaken by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study they conducted on the classification of sonar signals using a neural network. In this project I have briefly explained what I have done after each step within the project. The project contains 3 main sections.
The 3 main sections are:
1) Importing correct packages and ML models to be used
2) Data Preprocessing
3) Run ML model and predict if attributes are a Rock or a Mine.
